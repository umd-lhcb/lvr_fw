This the the Gen3 dev WIP GW

The over-temperature and under-voltage lockout failsafes have been added.

Module SPI_ALT.vdl has not been fully simulated.  It is a development item that will need updates to integrate it with the rest of the gateware.  The rest of the gateway needs many mods to adequately address the various configs for the LVR.
