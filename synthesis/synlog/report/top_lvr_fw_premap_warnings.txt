@W: MT530 :"z:\windows\lvr_fw\lvr_fw_sep2\hdl\spi_slave.vhd":101:4:101:5|Found inferred clock spi_slave|I_SPI_RX_STRB_inferred_clock which controls 73 sequential elements including spi_slave_pm.RX_32BIT_SREG[31:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may adversely impact design performance.
